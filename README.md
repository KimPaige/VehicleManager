# VehicleManager

The purpose of this repository is to create a website with the purpose of being able to manage vehicle maintenance. 
I came up with this idea after I not only let my motorbike nearly run out of oil, but then put the wrong type of oil in it, and since I have an interest in learning Javascript, thought this would be a good opportunity to do just that. 

I will only be working on this project when I have spare time between assignments and work, and to begin with it will just be me playing around and getting used to a new language.
